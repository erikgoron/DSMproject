###### Dynamic and kinematic analysis of the strandbeest 

Kinematic and dynamic modelling of the strandbeest (see below) with MATLAB. We developed a 2D model of a dynamical system (strandbeest). Our program gives us position, speed, accelerations, forces and moments for each component of our mechanism (at joints) when a driving external actuator forces the mechanism to move (In real life : the wind). An animation of the mechanism in motion and with force measurement at each joint can be ran with MAINDYN.m inside Dynamics Project folder.
